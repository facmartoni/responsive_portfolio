# Responsive portfolio

## https://facmartoni.github.io/responsive_portfolio/

This is a portfolio that I made during the courses "Online Web Development" and "Responsive Design" by Platzi. It contains a basic HTML code; CSS with media queries to improve the responsive design and a lot of use of the flexbox display; and a little script of JS for a hamburger menu. All of the text in the web page is an example, nothing is real.
